“Posągi” (1989) translated from Polish by Anna Karpiuk and Piotr Migdał

What bliss when a tyrant’s tall statues are shattered  
But in each shard of bronze in each shrapnel of stone  
There lingers a trace of the spark that once fluttered  
In the one that was thrown from the throne

And all men who saw the almighty’s rise and fall  
And all new statues cast out of metal and dust  
Will carry a splinter of the same tyrant’s soul  
Fact of life never to be discussed

What bliss when a tyrant’s tall statues are shattered  
But a void on the plinth is what world cannot bear  
For statues are all made of one ancient matter  
That somewhere deep inside we all share
